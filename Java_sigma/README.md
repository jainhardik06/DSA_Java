# My DSA Journey in Java

This folder documents my personal journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. It contains a comprehensive collection of Java programs, solutions, and notes created as I explored various DSA topics, including:

- Basic Java programs
- Array and 2D Array problems
- Sorting algorithms
- Leetcode problems
- File handling examples
- Threading and synchronization
- Various pattern printing programs


## Folder Structure

- `Java_sigma/` - Core Java programs and DSA solutions from my learning journey
- `Array/` - Array-based problems and algorithms
- `Array2/` - Advanced array problems
- `2DArray/` - 2D array problems
- `basicSorting/` - Sorting algorithm implementations
- `leetcode_problems/` - Solutions to popular Leetcode problems in Java


## How to Use

Browse the folders to find Java source files for different DSA topics. Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently. These resources reflect my progress and understanding as I learned DSA in Java.

## Live Notes
